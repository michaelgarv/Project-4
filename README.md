Final Project = Final Project Submission!

Within Final Project Folder:

Models: 

High_scores_optimized.h5 (Model 1) and low_scores_optimized.h5 (Model 2)

Michael.ipynb: Cleaned Data-

How Data was cleaned using Python (Pandas), Merged, And Data Base created

Allen-checkpoint.ipynb - Machine Learning Models

Using Machine Learning two models were finalized for use to paint predictions

Problem worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing:

Which MLB team in the NL West is most likely to win the division in 2023, using 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2021 as training data & 2022 statistics as the test data 

Using: batting data, pitching data, wins
Batting
Batting Average
Slugging Percentage
Pitching
ERA
WHIP


We will be using :
Python Pandas - Cleaning and creating dataframes + Spark (ML)
Tableau- Displaying Data
And Machine learning (ML) + Scikit-learn 



Data Model Implementation 

A Python script initializes, trains, and evaluates a model (10 points)
The data is cleaned, normalized, and standardized prior to modeling (5 points)
The model utilizes data retrieved from Spark (5 points)
The model demonstrates meaningful predictive power at least 75% classification accuracy or 0.80 R-squared. (5 points)


Data Model Optimization 

The model optimization and evaluation process showing iterative changes made to the model and the resulting changes in model performance is documented in either a CSV/Excel table or in the Python script itself (15 points)
Overall model performance is printed or displayed at the end of the script (10 points)
